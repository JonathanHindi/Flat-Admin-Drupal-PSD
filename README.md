## Roadmap
* If someone is free to convert it to HTML/CSS, I can convert it a Drupal theme, While the most easy and suggested way is to fork [Seven](https://drupal.org/project/seven) (Drupal 7 Default Admin Theme), and style it with CSS directly as it's the same layout and no images needed only colors, margines and paddings.
* I create it in my freetime, So don't expect a ROADMAP full of features, Feel free to play with it and submit a pull request anytime :)

## Licence
* You are free to do whatever you want, It would be nice to refer back to [@JonathanHindi](http://twitter.com/JonathanHindi).
